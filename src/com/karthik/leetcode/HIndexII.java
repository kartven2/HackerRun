/*
 * LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/#/description
 * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer)
 * of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
 * "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each,
 * and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
 * For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher
 * has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
 * Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
 * two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
 * Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
 * Follow up for H-Index: What if the citations array is sorted in ascending order?
 * Could you optimize your algorithm?
